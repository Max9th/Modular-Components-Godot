# Modular templates for Godot Engine games

### 🏗️ Description
These are some modular components for the godot engine. They are made to work under any node.
Making game features modular helps you to implement new features and makes the pre-existing features easier to debug and edit.

### Components:
- ✅ state_comp (node-based state machine for NPCs)
- ✅ health_comp (health manager for player characters and NPCs)
- ✅ drag_comp (makes objects draggable)
- ✅ and a wire, for some reason (transmits power) [part of another project]
